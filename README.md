This Home Assistant addon is designed to track and manage various metrics related to chicken egg production and related expenses. It monitors daily egg production, including different egg types (e.g., white, beige, mint, olive, brown, and chocolate eggs), as well as broken and stored eggs.

The addon also tracks feed consumption (pellets and scratch grains), bedding, and miscellaneous costs, calculating the total expenses involved in keeping the chickens. It calculates profit from egg sales, taking into account production, costs, and sales values, providing insights into the profitability of your chicken farm.

Additional functionality includes tracking historical data such as the last purchase or sale, and calculating cost per kilogram for feed. This addon offers a comprehensive overview of your chicken operation, helping you keep track of production, usage, and financial performance.
